# PROM: Personal Knowledge Graph Construction with Large Language Models

**PROM** is a novel framework for **P**ersonal Knowledge G**r**aph C**o**nstruction with Large Language **M**odels. This system efficiently constructs Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) from natural conversations, emphasizing context preservation and seamless knowledge fusion through LLM integration.

## 🚀 Overview

The growing volume of digital information requires effective Personal Knowledge Management (PKM). PROM addresses this challenge by automatically constructing knowledge graphs from unstructured conversational data, leveraging the power of Large Language Models to extract, integrate, and refine knowledge relationships.

### Key Features

- **🤖 LLM-Powered Extraction**: Utilizes prompt engineering and few-shot learning for accurate knowledge extraction
- **🔄 API Proxy Engine**: Supports multiple LLM backends (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) with unified interface
- **🧠 Knowledge Fusion**: Multi-strategy approach to resolve conflicts and enhance graph coherence
- **📊 Comprehensive Evaluation**: Multi-dimensional assessment including embedding analysis, link prediction, and RAG-based evaluation
- **🔧 Knowledge Correction**: Advanced correction mechanisms for graph quality improvement
- **📈 Visualization**: Interactive knowledge graph visualization and analytics

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kazgu/prom.git
   cd prom
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   - API Documentation: `http://localhost:8000/api/docs/`

## 🔧 Core Components

### 1. API Proxy Engine

The API Proxy Engine provides a unified interface for multiple LLM backends:

```python
from api_proxy.services.router import ModelRouter

# Route requests to appropriate LLM backend
router = ModelRouter()
response = router.route_request(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Extract knowledge from this text..."}]
)
```

### 2. Knowledge Extraction

Extract structured knowledge from conversational data:

```python
from knowledge_graph.services.extractor import TripleExtractor

extractor = TripleExtractor()
triples = extractor.extract_triples(
    text="John works at Microsoft in Seattle.",
    confidence_threshold=0.7
)
# Output: [(John, works_at, Microsoft), (Microsoft, located_in, Seattle)]
```

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Knowledge Graph Metrics**: Entity count, relation diversity, graph density
- **Domain Coverage**: Vocabulary coverage, contextual completeness
- **Embedding Analysis**: Entity clustering, classification accuracy
- **Link Prediction**: TransE embeddings, MRR, Hits@K metrics
- **RAG Evaluation**: Question answering performance, reasoning quality



### Key Findings

- **High Confidence Extraction**: 17.4% of triples extracted with confidence ≥ 0.9
- **Good Quality Coverage**: 41.9% of triples with confidence 0.7-0.8
- **Rich Semantic Diversity**: Over 140 distinct entity types captured
- **Balanced Connectivity**: Moderate graph density preventing over-connection
